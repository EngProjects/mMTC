# Project: Massive Machine Type Communication

This Git repository pertains to massive machine-type communication (mMTC), with a focus on uncoordinated/unsourced random access (URA).
The repository features three branches:
  * **main**: Generic information about this project, along with related resources
  * **github.io**: Source code for [mMTC](https://engprojects.github.io/mMTC/) website
  * **code**: Source code for simulations


## Branch **code**:

This branch contains the source code used to generate published simulation results. This branch is organized as follows: 

- **CCS**: 
  - Contains code used in various CCS/Coded Demixing papers. Please see `./CCS/README.md` for more information
- **CEFURA**:
  - Contains code used in *Scalable Cell-Free Massive MIMO Unsourced Random Access System* (https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06105)
- **FASURA**:
  - Contains code used in *FASURA: A Scheme for Quasi-Static Massive MIMO Unsourced Random Access Channels* (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9833940).
- **HashBeam**:
